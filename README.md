# Stata-AMCMC
Stata and Mata code for adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation; Stata code for Bayesian estimation of mixed logit models and truncated quantile regression models

These are the materials that go along with my Stata Journal article (http://https://ideas.repec.org/a/tsj/stataj/v14y2014i3p623-661.html) on estimation and sampling using Markov chain Monte 
Carlo methods. 

While most of the code is accessible through Stata (using the viewsource command), the exception is the code that constructs
the associated Mata library. This file is included in this package as amcmc_04152014.do.
